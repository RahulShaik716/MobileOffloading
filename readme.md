To run the Android application as a Master or Slave, follow these steps:

Running as Master:

Install the application on your Android device using the provided APK file (follow the previous instructions).

Launch the application by tapping on its icon.

On the main screen, click on the "Master" button to start the Master mode.

Grant the required permissions for Bluetooth, location access, and any other necessary permissions requested by the application.

Once in the Master mode, you will see options to start service discovery, connect with discovered devices, and perform matrix computation.

To start service discovery, click on the "Start Discovery" button. This will scan for available Slave devices in proximity.

Once the discovery process is complete, you will see a list of discovered devices. Select the desired Slave device from the list.

After selecting a Slave device, you can connect to it by clicking on the "Connect" button. This establishes a connection for distributed computation.

Once connected, you can initiate the matrix computation by clicking on the "Compute Matrix" button. The computation will be performed both on the Master and Slave devices.

The execution times and results will be displayed on the screen.

Running as Slave:

Install the application on your Android device using the provided APK file (follow the previous instructions).

Launch the application by tapping on its icon.

On the main screen, click on the "Slave" button to start the Slave mode.

Grant the required permissions for Bluetooth, location access, and any other necessary permissions requested by the application.

Once in the Slave mode, the application will listen for connection requests from a Master device.

When a connection request is received from a Master device, the Slave device will accept the request and establish a connection.

The Slave device will then monitor its battery level and location periodically.

The monitored information will be sent back to the Master device upon request.

You can view the battery level and location information on the screen.

To start periodic monitoring, click on the "Start Monitoring" button.
